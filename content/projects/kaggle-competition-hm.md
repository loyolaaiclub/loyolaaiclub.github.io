We participated in the H&M Group's [Personalized Fashion Recommendations](https://www.kaggle.com/c/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations) competition in April of 2022.

We built our solution in PyTorch using an LSTM.

You can view the source code for our solution on [GitHub](https://github.com/mhyatt000/hm).
