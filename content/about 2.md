Like the industrial revolution, artificial intelligence (AI) is changing life as
we know it. AI may eventually become fundamental to everyday work, just like
reading and writing. We meet to exchange ideas related to interdisciplinary AI
use and apply them in real world situations in order to give students from all
walks of life exposure to tools that will enhance the way they contribute to
society.

We bring guest speakers to campus to discuss how they use AI in the real world
and host workshops to help students build technical skills. We intend to build a
network of students and alumni and foster professional development.
